# Callout

Callouts are an excerpt of text that has been pulled out and used as a visual clue to draw the eye to the text. They are used
to help direct a user's attention to important pieces of information.

## When to Use

Differentiating a block of text from the content that surrounds it, for example:

- Important snippets of information
- Quotes
- Examples
- Additional information about the page

## When not to Use

- Warning notifications
- Page alerts

Use callouts very sparingly - it’s less effective if it’s overused.
